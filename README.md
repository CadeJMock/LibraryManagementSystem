# LibraryManagementSystem
This is a final project for my CSCI-428 course at East Texas A&amp;M

It is a skeleton/precursor for my future CSCI-440 course where I will create a Library Management System following my guides from my current Systems Analysis &amp; Design course. However, that project will have a technology stack involving some database, html/css for a website, and python for backend logic.
